If you want to become a project contributor you might want to have a look at this:

Project page: http://owtf.org
github page: https://github.com/owtf/owtf
owtf git installation script (very basic atm): owtf_dir/install/install_git.sh
GIT installation/setup instructions: http://help.github.com/linux-set-up-git/

Development IDE: After using only vi for months I switched to: eclipse + pydev
Installation steps (should work fine on Ubuntu / Backtrack / Kali Linux):
1) apt-get install eclipse
Below is mostly from these guides but correcting the pydev.org URL: 
http://pluthon.garage.maemo.org/1st_edition/pydev.html
http://cs.calvin.edu/curriculum/cs/106/resources/pythonOnEclipse/1.installingPyDev/
2) (From Eclipse) Help / Install New Software / "Add"
3) On the dialog box: Name -> PyDev. Location: http://pydev.org/updates
4) Click on the PyDev checkbox that appears below
5) Next / Next / Finish :)
6) Trust the Atana certificate
7) Restart Eclipse
8) Go to Windows / Preferences
9) In the dialog box select Pydev / Interpreter - Python.
10) On the python interpreters box (at the top) click "New"
11) Interpreter name: python2.6 + Interpreter Location: /usr/bin/python2.6 (or run whereis python2.6)
12) ok, apply + fight until you get the settings you like :P
13) This might help: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/186118/eclipse-fonts-and-background-color
14) Right click on code window / Preferences / Click on "Show whitespace characters" and make sure that "insert spaces for tabs" is ENABLED!!!
15) Ensure that 1 tab is replaced by 4 spaces.
16) If you are like me you might find the following helpful to have word wrap working in Eclipse:

17) External library method/properties completion:
Project / PyDev - PYTHON PATH / External libraries tab / Add Source Folder:
/usr/share/pyshared/twisted (for twisted completion, location on bactrack 5)

Importing the OWTF pydev-project into Eclipse.
1) In eclipse, go to files > import > general > existing projects into workspace
2) Select the OWTF folder as root directory.
3) Check the OWTF project.
4) Click on Finish. The OWTF project will be imported.

In order to write the code for OWTF in the pythonic way, it is recommended to enable PEP 8 styling guide in eclipse.
Follow these steps to integrate pep8.py with eclipse:
1) In your Eclipse, go to Window->Preferences
2) Choose PyDev->Editor->Code Analysis
3) Go to pep8.py tab
4) Choose the radio button for warning and click Ok.

right click on editor window / preferences DOES NOT WORK for many things you should:
Go to Window / Preferences / PyDev / Editor and adjust your settings here (tab defaults here override the Eclipse defaults, for example)

To use vim from Eclipse for free:
TODO: http://sourceforge.net/projects/eclim/

DID NOT WORK:
1) Download this: http://sourceforge.net/projects/vimplugin/
2) Copy it here (Backtrack 5, but you get the idea): /usr/lib/eclipse/plugins
3) Restart Eclipse
4) Go to Window / Preferences / Vim Plugin / set the location to: /usr/bin/vim

The tasks to be done should be added as a TO-DO comment in eclipse.
(Refer http://pydev.org/manual_adv_tasks.html). The comment below will add task to the TODO list.
#TODO: Link/Message
