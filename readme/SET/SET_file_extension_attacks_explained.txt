Below is largely from the SET menus and trial and error - Official site: www.secmaniac.com

NOTE: SET only uses File extension attacks for Payload 1, which in OWTF is expanded into payloads: 1_zip, 1_rar, 1_zce, 1_rce

File extension attacks explained:

The DLL Hijacker vulnerability will allow normal file extensions to 
 call local (or remote) .dll files that can then call your payload or 
 executable. In this scenario it will compact the attack in a zip file
 and when the user opens the file extension, will trigger the dll then
 ultimately our payload. During the time of this release, all of these
 file extensions were tested and appear to work and are not patched. This
 will continiously be updated as time goes on.

   Enter the choice of the file extension you want to attack:

    1. Windows Address Book (Universal)
    2. Microsoft Help and Support Center
    3. wscript.exe (XP)
    4. Microsoft Office PowerPoint 2007
    5. Microsoft Group Converter
    6. Safari v5.0.1
    7. Firefox <= 3.6.8
    8. Microsoft PowerPoint 2010
    9. Microsoft PowerPoint 2007
    10. Microsoft Visio 2010
    11. Microsoft Word 2007
    12. Microsoft Powerpoint 2007
    13. Microsoft Windows Media Encoder 9
    14. Windows 7 and Vista Backup Utility
    15. EnCase
    16. IBM Rational License Key Administrator
    17. Microsoft RDP
    
NOTE on RAR vs ZIP exploitability of file extension attacks: 
Do you want to use a zipfile or rar file. Problem with zip
is they will have to extract the files first, you can't just
open the file from inside the zip. Rar does not have this 
restriction and is more reliable
